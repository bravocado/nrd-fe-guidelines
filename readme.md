# Narrada Front-end Guidelines

### Description
This document contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at [Narrada Communications](http://narrada.com). Each item here represents either:

1. A reminder to follow existing standards or industry conventions.
2. Guidance on what constitutes professional patterns and organization.
3. A decision we've made favoring one method over its alternatives.

What this document is not is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does not provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives unless there is common confusion about which option is best.

These guidelines have been compiled looking at various previously written guidelines and in some sections been directly quoted.


### Goals
Our motivations in creating this document are to:

1. Foster code consistency across our projects.
2. Facilitate ease of maintenance.
3. Ensure we create professional quality web sites.
4. Guide staff on-boarding or educate new developers.

This document is not intended to replace common sense, conventions requested by particular clients, teams, or prevent expressive or creative solutions to problems. Team or project-specific agreements or client requests will always supersede this document's content.

## General Guidelines

1. All front-end code should display clear separation of presentation, content, and behaviour.
2. Markup should be well formed, semantically correct and generally valid.
3. Gracefully degrade functionality when not present (e.g GPS, box-shadow, forms etc).

### Indentation
For all languages, indent your code with spaces. The default tab size should be set as 4.

### Readability and Compression
We encourage readability over file-size when it comes to maintaining existing files. Plenty of white-space is encouraged, along with ASCII art, where appropriate. There is no need for any developer to purposefully compress HTML or CSS, nor obfuscate JavaScript.
We should use server-side or build processes to automatically minify and gzip all static client-side files, such as CSS and JavaScript.

## Browser Support
- IE9+
- Google Chrome 29+
- Firefox 47+
- Safari 9.1+
- Opera 39+
- Android Browser 4.4+
- Chrome for Android 51+

## Base Frameworks
We encourage you using [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com). Since we have tight deadlines, we need a fast and robust front-end frameworks and also have a big community in case you need a hint when debugging.

### Document Type
Keep your code terse. Forget about your old XHTML habits.

```html
<!doctype html>
```

All markup should be delivered as UTF-8, as it's the most friendly for internationalization. It should be designated in both the HTTP header and the head of the document.

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

### Open Graph
The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.
To turn your web pages into graph objects, you need to add basic metadata to your page. We've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you'll place additional `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` of your web page. The four required properties for every page are:

- og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".
- og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.
- og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.
- og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".

Twitter has its own `<meta>` tags that are similar to the Open Graph protocol, but uses the "twitter" prefix instead of "og". As with Facebook, only a few are required. The type of display format we're requesting from Twitter is also specified:

```html
<meta name="twitter:title" content="your title goes here">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="your description here">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="http://url.com/image.jpg">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
```


### General HTML Markup
The following are general guidelines for structuring your HTML markup. Authors are reminded to always use markup which represents the semantics of the content in the document being created.

- Use `<p>` elements for paragraph delimiters as opposed to multiple `<br />` tags.
- Items in list form should always be housed in a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>`, never a set of `<div>`s or `<p>`s.
- Make use of `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` tags (and Scope attribute) when appropriate.
- Make use of `<dl>` (definition lists) and `<blockquote>`, when appropriate.
- Use `<label>` fields to label each form field. The `for` attribute should associate itself with the input field, so users can click the labels and obtain focus.
- Tables shouldn't ever be used for page layout – only for tabular data.

While the HTML5 specification defines quotes around attributes as optional for consistency with attributes that accept whitespace, all attributes should be quoted.

```html
<a href="mylink.html" title="My Link Title" data-attribute="32">This is my Link</a>
```

### Performance
Unless there's a valid reason for loading your scripts before your content, don't block the rendering of your page. If your style sheet is heavy, isolate the styles that are absolutely required initially and defer the loading of the secondary declarations in a separate style sheet. Two HTTP requests is significantly slower than one, but the perception of speed is the most important factor.

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hello, world.</title>
<body>
    <p>...</p>
</body>
<script src="your-script.js"></script>
```

### General CSS Principles

- Every time you write inline styles in your markup, a front-end developer somewhere dies - whether it's in a style tag or directly in the markup. Don't do it.
- Add CSS through external files, minimizing the number of files, if possible. CSS should always be included in the `<head>` of the document.
- Use the `<link>` tag to include, never `@import`.
- All CSS rules should have a space after the selector colon and a trailing semi-colon.
- Don't over qualify class or ID selectors. Leads to specificity issues further down the line.
- ID's are an unique identifier. Each element can have only one ID. Each page can have only one element with that ID.
- Classes are **NOT** unique. Any styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class.
- For each level of markup nesting, indent your CSS to match. For example:

```css
nav {}
    nav li {}
        nav li a {}

.content {}
    .content p {}
```

### Naming Convention

The following sections describe one simple approach, and as long as the types are defined on a project and the patterns are followed, then a clear meaning can be interpreted fairly quickly and easily reading through the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Every site will have distinct requirements but some examples of things that can be standardized on a site build include:

- Page Level Rules (grids, site template types, and so on)
- Components
- State
- Utilities

The following sections describe how some might work.

#### Page Level Rules
Any site is liable to have a standard baseline set of grids and types of pages. These grids can be collected into their own distinct set of component files — using a broad definition of a global "thing" as a component.

#### Components
Components are a high level concept for organizing CSS files and rules. A component simply means a grouped set of rules pertaining to an object or set of related objects on a page.

Additionally, encapsulating these components into distinct files is a great option. Within this file, using a naming convention is a tremendous help here for code maintainability and readability.

Group styles under a simple name-space using a prefix-suffix-modifier type pattern such as:

```css
/* core component */
.component { ... }

/* component elements */
.component-header { ... }
.component-content { ... }

/* component descendant */
.component-content-group { ... }

/* component descendant element */
.component-content-group-header { ... }
.component-content-group-imgs { ... }
```

This type of pattern is easy to read, extend, and follow in the absence of something more sophisticated.

Additionally, generally components will be the only CSS class with distinct names that do not have prefixes before the core, root, or base name of the component (e.g. above we are using component).

Just to get developers thinking, these might be things like:

- navbar
- footer
- page-info
- article-date
- widget

#### State
A state for an element or component is presentation information for a given component. This may be a dynamic state set by JavaScript or a user interaction, but not always. It could also be a preset from the server or the results after a transaction. State modifiers are a great way for a distinct class to be provided to engineers unfamiliar with the design to be provided hooks for various things. This is slightly different than JS specific classes, however.

State rules will use the `is-` prefix.

```css
.component-group.is-full { ... } 
.component-group.is-expired { ... }
```

Treating components' state as a modifier that is boolean (i.e. true or false) also:

- Semantically helps provide information about the content.
- Separates the code for state from default presentation.
- Removes the need to update corresponding states or components if the name of either changes.
- This last point is important from a maintenance perspective.

It's best to try to restrict these state indicators as being restricted to a specific component.

#### Utility
A utility is a type of component modifier that is specifically designed to be used on more than one component type. If it was restricted to a single component, it would simply be a modifier.

Utilities will use the prefix of `util-` and should serve only the modifier purpose intended without side effects when applied to any component, or component descendant.

```css
.util-text-center { ... }
.util-text-left { ... }
.util-float-right { ... }
```


### CSS Comments
We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code. You will use automated server-side or other build processes to optimize files (eg: Gulp, Grunt or CodeKit). The ability for another developer to read the code is paramount above other concerns, especially if optimization can be handled another way.

Use block and describe your stylesheet

```css
/**
 *
 * Block comment
 *
 */
```

Use section comment for each section

```css
/*=============================================
=            Section comment block            =
=============================================*/

...

/*=====  End of Section comment block  ======*/
```

Use sub-section to identify a small part of your stylesheet

```css
/*----------  Subsection comment block  ----------*/
```

### General JS Principles

- Use external JavaScript files. **Do NOT include JavaScript in-line in the page unless there is a good reason**.
- Name variables and functions logically and in camelCase. Sensible names that are long are preferred to short names that make no sense.
- Try to write functions to follow the principle that they should do one thing and do it well. If you can see that a function is becoming more complex, abstract it out into multiple functions - it will become more readable, reusable and will make more sense to someone unfamiliar to the code.
- Prefix jQuery collection variables with the dollar ($) character e.g `$headerChildren`
- Class declarations should start with a capital letter.
- Constants or configuration variables should be at the start of a class and written in CAPS.


#### Load external JavaScript at the bottom of page

```html
    
    // Bad
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
    </head>

    // Good
    <!-- end of your code -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
    </body>
```

#### Initialize your external JavaScript file
     - Use another JavaScript file to fire a functions on external JavaScript file.
     - Unless you're using automated build system, don't minify that code. So the programmer can use that code too.

```html 
    
    <!-- Bad -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
             // initialize code
        });
    </script>

    <!-- Good -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="your/external/javascript/link"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="your/initilize/file"></script>

```
#### Init code

```javascript
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // initialize code
    });

```


### JS Structure

We encourage you to these rules when building a script:

#### Assignment

````javascript
// Bad

var foo = " ",
      bar = " ";
var foobar = " ";


// Good

var foo        = " ";
var bar        = " ";
var foobaar = " ";

// or
var foo      = " ",
      bar      = " ",
      foobar = " ";

// or
var  // comment goes here
    foo      = " ",
    bar      = " ",
    foobar = " ";
```

#### Invoking

````javascript
// good
$(function(){
    func(1);
    func(2);
});


// bad
$(function(){
    func(1);
});
$(function(){
    func(2);
});

```

### Debugging

- We encourage you to add a debug flags when you on development phase.
- Use `console.log()` not `alert()`.

### JS Comments

Comment JavaScript code thoroughly and consider using a pattern such as those described by [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) so that documentation may be generated automatically.

### Readme File

You have to put readme file at the root of your project folder. Use [this](readme_example.md) as your starter.

### Using Git

It's a **must** to use Git for every front-end project.


### Image Compression

All images should be compressed. Any uploaded images from user should compressed by server side (ex: PHP GD library). For client side compression tools, see [below](#external-tools).
